# Chain-of-Astra
Chain of astra is a type of meta architecture adapted to intensive cognitive reasoning, by analyzing the response of a chain of thought model, improving its response and analyzing it, as many times as you want.
This has a zero point threshold, which will depend on the question, this is the maximum point to which you can improve the question. Once you have passed this point, your reasoning capacity will be so great that it will be incomprehensible to understand it, in addition to telling yourself that you can't do it anymore, and analyze why you can't do it anymore in such a compact and abstract way that no human could understand its complexity of the reason why the last iteration before the threshold point is so perfect of point zero.
